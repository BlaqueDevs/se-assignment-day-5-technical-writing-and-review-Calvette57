Non-Experts (Regular Folks):

Approach: Simplify technical jargon and focus on high-level concepts. Use analogies and avoid overly complex explanations. Highlight benefits and practical applications.
Example: Explain a new feature as a tool that makes a task easier, without delving into the underlying technical processes.
2. Communication Style
Tech Experts:

Style: Be precise and formal. Engage in technical discussions and provide data-driven evidence.
Example: Use technical presentations, white papers, or detailed documentation that includes technical specifications and performance metrics.
Non-Experts:

Style: Be informal and approachable. Use simple language and focus on how the technology impacts their daily life or solves specific problems.
Example: Use visual aids, infographics, or videos that demonstrate the technology’s functionality and benefits in everyday scenarios.
3. Presentation Format
Tech Experts:

Format: Provide technical documentation, detailed reports, and in-depth webinars. Allow for Q&A sessions that dive into technical specifics.
Example: A technical demo or a live coding session where you walk through complex scenarios and answer technical questions.
Non-Experts:

Format: Use engaging formats like explainer videos, simple slides, and interactive demos. Provide clear, concise summaries and FAQs.
Example: A user-friendly tutorial or a demo video showing how to use the software with step-by-step instructions and clear visuals.
4. Feedback and Support
Tech Experts:

Feedback: Be prepared for detailed questions and technical feedback. Offer advanced support channels like technical forums or expert-level customer service.
Example: Provide access to API documentation, technical support teams, or community forums where users can discuss technical aspects.
Non-Experts:

Feedback: Expect questions about usability and practical concerns. Offer accessible support options like help centers, live chat, and straightforward user guides.
Example: Create easy-to-follow guides, offer customer support via chat or phone, and provide clear answers to common user questions.
5. Training and Education
Tech Experts:

Training: Offer in-depth training sessions or workshops that focus on advanced features and technical capabilities.
